databases is a collection of data in a format that can be easily accessible. 
it has three porperties: i> stores data, ii> feautures like security and scalibilty iii> easier to insert update or delete data 
SQL : realtional database -> (data stored in Tables)   eg. MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL  and  MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j
NoSQL : non relational database -> (data stored in document/ key-val/ graphs, etc) 

SQL : Stuctured Query Language : is a programming language used to interact with relational databases
column: design(schema)
row: tuple
SQL is case insensitive

/* 
    database
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name     : is use dto create a databse
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db_name       : is used to dleete a pre existing database
    USE db_name                 : to use a database it need to be specified (even before table creation it need to be mentioned)
    SHOW DATABASES : is used to see all the databases
    SHOW TABLES : is used to see all the tables of databases
*/

/*
UNSIGNED: all the neagtive number goes to the positive numbers thus increasing the range of positive number

/*
NOT NULL : columns cannot have a null value
UNIQUE : all values in column are different
DEFAULT : sets the default value of a column
CHECK : it can limit the values allowed in the column   (ex: CONSTRAINT age_check CHECK (age>=18 AND city="Delhi"))

reverse engneering -> of databases is used to visualize the data
PRIMARY KEY : it is a column(or set of columns in a table) that uniquely identifies each row. There is only 1 PK and it should be not null.
FOREIGN KEY : it is a column (or set of columns) in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. it could have duplicate and null values. there can be multiple FKs.
